# Making of Weather-near-me a Weather App

**What does this app does ?**

1. It will give the weather of that place whose name you enter.
2. You can also get weather of your current location.


**How it will do so ?**

I have used 3 free APIs of [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/).

1. Weather API - It will return weather forecast of 6 days (including today) by taking latitude and longitude of the place entered/captured.
2. Geo Coding API - It will return the latitude and longitude of the name of the place entered. It takes City Name as the Parameter.
3. Reverse Geo Coding (For fetching user's current location weather) - It will return the City Name. It takes 2 Parameters latitude and longitude and finds the city from these.
